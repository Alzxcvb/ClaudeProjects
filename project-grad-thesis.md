## Core Research Question

How do systemic constraints and interlinked crises (polycrises) limit global growth, and what frameworks can help understand, predict, or mitigate these limits?

### Keywords
Limits to growth, polycrisis, ecological constraints, economic feedback loops, systemic risk, sustainability transitions, global crises interdependencies.

### Purpose
Produce a thesis that is theoretically rigorous, grounded in quantitative modeling, and practically applicable to global sustainability policy or finance.

## Thesis Angles Explored

### 1. Ecological & Environmental Limits
- Inspired by Meadows et al., *Limits to Growth* (1972)
- Focus on planetary boundaries (Rockstrom et al., 2009)
- Examining overshoot, resource depletion, and climate tipping points

### 2. Polycrisis Analysis
- Definition: Multiple overlapping crises (economic, environmental, social, geopolitical) that compound risks
- Networked risk frameworks:
  - Cascading failures in complex systems (Perrow, 1984; Taleb, 2012)
  - Resilience theory and adaptive systems (Holling, 1973)
- Real-world examples: COVID-19 + economic inequality + climate shocks; Ukraine conflict + energy transition + global food insecurity

### 3. Economic Modeling
- Resource scarcity constraints on GDP growth
- Ecological economics vs neoclassical economics (Daly, 1996)
- Feedback loops in supply chains, energy systems, and climate

### 4. Policy & Governance
- Multi-level governance for polycrisis mitigation
- Systems thinking frameworks (Meadows, 2008; Sterman, 2000)
- Role of international organizations, finance, and sustainable development policies

### 5. Quantitative / Analytical Approaches
- System dynamics modeling (Stella, Vensim, or MATLAB)
- Network analysis for interlinked crises
- Scenario analysis: "what if" limits on growth under different assumptions of resource depletion, climate, and social unrest

## Where We Left Off

### Thesis Development
- Deciding between purely ecological limits modeling vs polycrisis modeling combining economic, social, and environmental systems.
- **Leaning toward: polycrisis + systems modeling** — more novel and globally applicable.

### Methodology (needs finalizing)
- Network theory modeling of cascading crises?
- System dynamics modeling with scenario analysis?
- Hybrid approach combining both?

### Program Targeting
- Oxford, TUM, and BI were top priorities (funding + alignment).
- Fulbright, CBS, and Lund as secondary options.

### Open Next Steps
1. Narrow specific case studies or datasets (e.g., global energy supply chains, climate shocks, COVID-19 + economic systems)
2. Refine research question into a testable hypothesis
3. Decide on specific modeling software or analytical method
4. Map out application deadlines and funding strategies for top programs
5. Draft and refine personal statements emphasizing systems thinking and global problem-solving
6. Coordinate letter of recommendation requests with specific narrative highlights per program

---

## Strategic Notes
- Draft essays once, tailor for each program
- Tie ALL experience to solving polycrisis / systemic challenges
- Emphasize impact potential, leadership, and analytical rigor for scholarships
- Highlight international perspective, cross-cultural adaptability, and travel experience
- Provide recommenders with high-level talking points per program
